        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p class="profile-paragraph">
          After a few months of varying levels of success trading options, one
          of the bits of advice I kept coming across was to journal my trades. I
          started by just writing them down in a notebook, but eventually
          realized I wasn't going through them in order to learn. I moved over
          to taking notes in excel which consisted of the various stats on the
          trade and my emotions before, during, and after the trade was
          completed, in addition to what I may have learned from that trade. I
          wanted something that looked better and more inviting, more user
          friendly, and more robust than just Excel cells...needless to say,
          there wasn't much out there. Enter this website. It is my hope that
          this site will enable me to become a better trader by making my data,
          notes, and other information more accessible and encourage me to
          actively utilize the lessons I learn daily by trading options in the
          stock market.<br /><br />
          My goal is to become emotionally, financially, mentally, and
          physically fit and content by focusing on diet, exercise, mediation,
          winning trades, retiring early, and most importantly spending quality
          AND quantity time with my daughter. It is my assesment that the best
          way to achieve these goals is to become an expert at Technical
          Analysis, Macroeconomic Event Analysis, Portfolio Risk Management, and
          Self Awareness through Trading Psychology.

            One of the best places to find a wealth of information, also a great
            deal of worthless or misinformation is YouTube. Provided that a
            person is able to sift through the garbage that leads them in the
            wrong direction, or no direction to be equally accurate, and find
            the right channels in which to learn to make their own correct
            decisions and make winning trades, YouTube is one of the greatest
            learning resources the world has ever known. Hopefully by providing
            some of my favorites here, I will remember to stop in and check on
            them regularly, but also provide a good start for those looking to
            take in some invaluable information.
